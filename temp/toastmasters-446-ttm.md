Opening:

When I was hanging around in a Music Application last weak.I found a producer who's name is Alan Walker. 
His music is very popular and often used as some short videos' BGM, mixed with beautiful female vocal sound, you'll feel totally relax and cured from one-day's hardwork.

Theme:

I wondered who will have this talent to make such cheerful melodys.To my surprise, Alan Walker, a 23 year-old kid, 8 years younger than me. He did have such a talent mixing melodies together to delight/satisfy his listenrs' ears.When tracing his route to success, I found clues of his studing on music. He listened tons of popular songs on Youtube, practise and practise then finally make his own greatist hist music work ——  Faded, which also make himself popular.
